## Description:
During this project, we will learn how to manipulate HTML and CSS languages.HTML is the structure of this page, it should be the first thing to write. CSS is the styling of this page, the design. I really encourage you to fix your HTML part before starting the styling. Indeed, without any structure, you canâ€™t apply any design.
