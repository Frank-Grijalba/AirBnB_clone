# AirBnB_clone project
###Content

## Description
The AirBnB clone project starts now untilâ€¦ the end of the first year. The goal of the project is to deploy on the server a simple copy of the AirBnB website, only some of them to cover all fundamental concepts of the higher level programming track.

We will have a complete web application composed by:

- A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
- A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
- A database or files that store data (data = objects)
- An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)-
